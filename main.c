     when choosing the parameters in `poll_timer_setup()`, located in

     finish due to other interrupt based routines. The simple solution

  /* Poll the matrix.

     `pull_row` and `probe_column` are defined in `hw_interface.c`.
     `probe_column` returns `0b00000001` for matrix positions where the
     key is pressed, `0b00000000` for the rest. This value is written
     to the lowest bit in the `key[k].bounce` register.

     If all but the highest bit are ones, the key may be transiting
     from a released to a pressed state, and we have registered the
     key as pressed for seven consecutive polls. If the key is not
     already marked as pressed in `key[k].pressed` we consider this a true
     press and not only interference. The key is then added to the
     send queue.

     If all but the highest bit are zeros, the key may be transiting
     from a pressed to a released state, and we have registered the
     key as released for seven consecutive polls. If the key is marked
     as pressed in `key[k].pressed` we consider this a true release. The
     key is then removed from the send queue.

     We don't want to release a key on a random glitch in the matrix
     poll. A false release would trigger an extra key press when the
     glitch has been shifted out of the bounce register.

     If noise is not present, and we want faster reaction to a key
     press event, it is possible to trigger the `key_press` on the first
     positive read of the poll. The release event on the other hand
     should always be debounced. Otherwise there would be several key
     presses on both the press and release event due to bounce. */
